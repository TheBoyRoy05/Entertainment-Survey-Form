      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <div id='summary'>
        <p>As the man who pulled bread and bombs out of the air with his revolutionary method of turning Nitrogen into Ammonia, Fritz Haber's research and inventions were monumental in not only agriculture, saving billions from starvation, but also in both World Wars, causing millions of deaths. As such, Haber's life is a tragedy, and yet that tragedy was necessary for our lives today. After all, an estimated 50% of the Nitrogen atoms in our bodies are a result of Haber's works. So here's tribute to the man who both gave and took countless lives.</p>
